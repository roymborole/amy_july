Chartify is a Python library that makes it easy for data scientists to create charts.

Why use Chartify?
-----------------

- Consistent input data format: Spend less time transforming data to get your charts to work. All plotting functions use a consistent tidy input data format.
- Smart default styles: Create pretty charts with very little customization required.
- Simple API: We've attempted to make the API as intuitive and easy to learn as possible.
- Flexibility: Chartify is built on top of `Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/>`_, so if you do need more control you can always fall back on Bokeh's API.

Installation
------------

1. Chartify can be installed via pip:

``pip3 install chartify``

2. Install chromedriver requirement (Optional. Needed for PNG output):
    - Install google chrome.
    - Download the appropriate version of chromedriver for your OS `here <https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/>`_.
    - Copy the executable file to a directory within your PATH.
	- View directorys in your PATH variable: ``echo $PATH``
	- Copy chromedriver to the appropriate directory, e.g.: ``cp chromedriver /usr/local/bin``
