Q2 2024 Macroeconomic Analysis for Lockheed Martin Corporation

Date: July 23, 2024

Revenue:
- Net sales were $18.1 billion in Q2 2024, up 8.6% from $16.7 billion in Q2 2023
    - Product sales of $15.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year
    - Services sales of $3.0 billion, up 3% year-over-year

- For the first six months of 2024, net sales were $35.3 billion, up 11% from $31.8 billion in the first six months of 2023

The increase in revenue was driven primarily by higher volume across Lockheed's major programs like the F-35, tactical missiles, integrated warfare systems, and space programs. This reflects rising demand and Lockheed's ability to ramp up production to meet customer needs amid the heightened global security environment.

Profitability:
- Gross profit margin was 11.7% in Q2 2024 vs 12.5% in Q2 2023
- Operating profit margin was 11.9% in Q2 2024 vs 12.8% in Q2 2023  
- Net profit margin was 9.1% in Q2 2024 vs 10.1% in Q2 2023

Profit margins contracted year-over-year due to unfavorable profit adjustments on certain programs like a classified fixed-price contract at Aeronautics and production programs at Rotary and Mission Systems. Higher material and labor costs also pressured margins. However, increased volume and strong program execution helped offset some of the margin headwinds.

Earnings:
- Earnings per share of $6.85 in Q2 2024, up 3.3% from $6.63 in Q2 2023
- For the first six months, EPS of $13.24 was flat year-over-year

The increase in EPS was driven by higher revenue, partially offset by lower operating margins. Share repurchases provided a modest tailwind to EPS growth.

Cash Flow:
- Operating cash flow of $3.5 billion in the first six months of 2024, up from $2.7 billion in the prior year period
- Free cash flow of $2.8 billion, up from $2.0 billion 

The strong cash flow performance was driven by improvements in working capital efficiency and timing of tax payments. Lockheed continues to deploy cash towards capital investments, dividends, and share buybacks.

Overall, Lockheed's results reflect the favorable defense spending environment globally as countries seek to bolster security capabilities. However, supply chain constraints, inflationary cost pressures, and fixed-price contract risks pose headwinds that Lockheed is working to mitigate. The company's significant backlog of $158 billion provides multi-year revenue visibility.
