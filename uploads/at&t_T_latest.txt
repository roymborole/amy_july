How has the company's revenue changed compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year?
Total operating revenues decreased 0.4% year-over-year and 1.1% sequentially. Service revenues increased 0.6% year-over-year but decreased 0.3% sequentially, while equipment revenues declined 5.4% year-over-year and 10.3% sequentially.

Is the growth in sales driven by volume or price increases?
Revenue growth was primarily driven by higher wireless service revenues from subscriber gains and ARPU increases, partially offset by declines in legacy wireline voice and data services. Equipment revenue declines reflected lower sales volumes.

Strong revenue growth can indicate rising demand or successful market expansion. Slowing or declining revenue might suggest market saturation or economic downturns – does the above relate to the stock and if so how?
AT&T's relatively flat revenues likely reflect a maturing wireless market and secular declines in legacy services, offset by gains in strategic areas like fiber broadband. The stock did not react significantly, suggesting the results were largely in-line with expectations.

What are the company's gross, operating, and net profit margins? 
- Gross Margin: 61.6%

Increasing profit margins suggest better cost management or pricing power, while declining margins may indicate rising costs or competitive pressures – does this apply to the company at all?
AT&T's declining operating and net profit margins point to rising costs and competitive pressures, including $480 million in restructuring charges related to network modernization in the quarter. However, the company's relatively stable gross margins indicate its pricing power remains intact.
