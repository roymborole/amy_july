- Solid global RevPAR growth of 4.9% in Q2 2024 vs Q2 2023, driven by ADR growth and occupancy improvement
- Increase in revenues driven by higher RevPAR, unit growth, and higher non-RevPAR franchise fees
- General and administrative expenses increased due to higher compensation costs
- Interest expense increased due to higher debt balances from new issuances
- Continuing legal expenses related to 2018 data security incident

Key highlights:
- Revenue increased 6% driven by RevPAR growth and unit expansion 
- EPS increased to $2.69 from $2.38 in Q2 2023

I did not find any clear signs of illegal or irregular behavior mentioned in the report. The company is facing some ongoing legal proceedings related to a 2018 data security incident, but it is managing and disclosing those appropriately.

There does seem to be a correlation between the company's performance metrics like RevPAR, revenues, net income, and its stock price/valuation, though the stock price is not explicitly provided. The solid operating results and earnings growth likely supported the stock price.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
