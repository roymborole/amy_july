{Second Quarter 2024} Macroeconomic Analysis for Booking Holdings Inc.

Date: August 1, 2024

Revenue Analysis:

o How has the company's revenue changed compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year?
- Total revenues increased by 7.3% to $5,859 million in Q2 2024 compared to $5,462 million in Q2 2023.
- Compared to Q1 2024, total revenues increased by 13.5% from $4,415 million.

o Is the growth in sales driven by volume or price increases? 
- The revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in volume, as room nights booked increased by 7.1% year-over-year in Q2 2024. However, the growth was partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and a decrease of approximately 1% in constant currency accommodation average daily rates (ADRs).

o Strong revenue growth can indicate rising demand or successful market expansion. Slowing or declining revenue might suggest market saturation or economic downturns – does the above relate to the stock and if so how?
- The strong year-over-year revenue growth indicates continued recovery and rising demand in the travel industry following the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in Asia and Europe. The sequential increase from Q1 2024 also suggests sustained momentum. This positive revenue trend could support the company's stock performance if it continues.

Profitability Analysis:

o What are the company's gross, operating, and net profit margins?
- The company does not provide gross profit margin figures. However, other profitability metrics for Q2 2024 are:

o How have these margins trended over recent quarters?
- The operating income margin increased from 28.9% in Q2 2023.
- The net income margin increased from 23.6% in Q2 2023.

o Increasing profit margins suggest better cost management or pricing power, while declining margins may indicate rising costs or competitive pressures – does this apply to the company at all?
- The increasing operating and net income margins suggest Booking Holdings was able to effectively manage costs and leverage operating efficiencies as travel demand recovered. However, the company noted some pressure on margins from the ongoing shift to a merchant business model, which incurs additional payment processing and other transaction costs.
