Third Quarter Ended April 28, 2024 Macroeconomic Analysis for Campbell Soup Company

Date: June 5, 2024

o How has the company's revenue changed compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year?
Net sales increased 6% in the third quarter of 2024 to $2.369 billion compared to $2.229 billion in the prior year quarter, primarily due to a 7-point benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands. On a two-year compounded annual growth rate, net sales increased 5%.

o Is the growth in sales driven by volume or price increases? 
The sales growth was not driven by volume/mix or net price realization, which were flat compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition benefit.

o Strong revenue growth can indicate rising demand or successful market expansion. Slowing or declining revenue might suggest market saturation or economic downturns – does the above relate to the stock and if so how?
The revenue growth was driven by the Sovos Brands acquisition rather than organic growth from rising demand or market expansion. The flat volume/mix indicates some market saturation or impact from economic conditions on consumer demand. This inorganic revenue growth may be viewed less favorably by investors compared to organic growth.

o What are the company's gross, operating, and net profit margins?
The gross profit margin was 30.9% in Q3 2024, compared to 30.0% in Q3 2023.
The operating profit margin was 10.5% in Q3 2024, compared to 11.4% in Q3 2023. 
The net profit margin was 5.6% in Q3 2024, compared to 7.2% in Q3 2023.

o How have these margins trended over recent quarters?
The gross profit margin increased 90 basis points from the prior year quarter, driven by productivity improvements, lower costs from cost savings initiatives, and favorable mark-to-market adjustments, partially offset by cost inflation, supply chain costs, and the dilutive impact of the acquisition.

The operating profit margin decreased from the prior year, impacted by higher administrative expenses from the acquisition costs and general inflation, partially offset by the higher gross margin.

The net profit margin decreased from the prior year, impacted by the lower operating margin and higher interest expense related to debt for the acquisition.

o Increasing profit margins suggest better cost management or pricing power, while declining margins may indicate rising costs or competitive pressures – does this apply to the company at all?
The increasing gross profit margin indicates better cost management through productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, as well as some pricing power to offset inflation. However, the declining operating and net profit margins suggest rising costs from the acquisition and higher interest expense that offset the gross margin improvement.
