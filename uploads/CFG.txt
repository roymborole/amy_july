{Q2 2024} Macroeconomic Analysis for Citizens Financial Group, Inc.
Date: August 6, 2024

o How has the company's revenue changed compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year?
Total revenue decreased $131 million, or 6.3%, compared to Q2 2023, driven by an 11% decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a 9% increase in noninterest income. Compared to Q1 2024, total revenue decreased $1.96 billion, or 50%, primarily due to a $1.44 billion decrease in net interest income.

o Is the growth in sales driven by volume or price increases? 
The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower net interest income due to a lower net interest margin and a decline in average interest-earning assets, reflecting the impact of higher funding costs and building liquidity, partially offset by higher asset yields and Non-Core portfolio runoff benefits.

o Strong revenue growth can indicate rising demand or successful market expansion. Slowing or declining revenue might suggest market saturation or economic downturns – does the above relate to the stock and if so how?
The declining revenue appears to be driven primarily by higher funding costs and building liquidity in response to the current economic environment, rather than market saturation or lack of demand.
