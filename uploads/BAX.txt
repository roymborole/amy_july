The company recorded a $430 million goodwill impairment charge in Q2 2024 related to its Chronic Therapies business within the Kidney Care segment. This was driven by the expected net proceeds from a potential sale of the overall Kidney Care business being lower than the previously estimated sum of the fair values of the two Kidney Care reporting units.

Baxter's results were negatively impacted by continued global supply chain challenges, including higher costs for raw materials, components and transportation. However, the company is seeing some improvement in availability and pricing.

Foreign currency movements had a negative translation impact on sales in Q2 2024 compared to the prior year period.

The company incurred significant costs in Q2 2024 related to its proposed separation of the Kidney Care business, which is expected to be completed in late 2024 or early 2025. These separation costs adversely impacted earnings and cash flow.

Baxter maintained its investment grade credit ratings, supporting continued access to capital markets to fund operations and strategic priorities. The new $2.05 billion bridge credit facility will provide financing flexibility related to the Kidney Care separation.

Overall, Baxter is focused on driving operational improvements, launching new products, and executing the planned Kidney Care separation in order to enhance profitability and shareholder value, despite the challenging global economic environment. The company did not identify any signs of illegal or irregular behavior in its results.
