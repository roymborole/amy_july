Here is a macroeconomic analysis for M&T Bank Corporation for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024:

Q2 2024 Macroeconomic Analysis for M&T Bank Corporation
Date: August 5, 2024

o How has the company's revenue changed compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year?
- Total revenue was $2.302 billion in Q2 2024, up 1% from $2.270 billion in Q1 2024 but down 12% from $2.602 billion in Q2 2023.

o Is the growth in sales driven by volume or price increases? 
- The modest increase in revenue from Q1 2024 was driven by higher net interest income from an improved net interest margin, as well as slightly higher noninterest income. The year-over-year decline was due to lower mortgage banking revenues and the gain on sale of the CIT business in Q2 2023.

o Strong revenue growth can indicate rising demand or successful market expansion. Slowing or declining revenue might suggest market saturation or economic downturns – does the above relate to the stock and if so how?
- The relatively flat revenues quarter-over-quarter and decline year-over-year do not suggest rising demand or market expansion. The results likely reflect the impact of higher interest rates on M&T's net interest margin and fee income sources like mortgage banking. Slowing economic growth could further pressure revenues going forward, which may weigh on the stock price.

o What are the company's gross, operating, and net profit margins?  
- The gross profit margin is not provided, but the net interest margin was 3.59% in Q2 2024.
- No operating profit margin is given, but the efficiency ratio was 55.3% in Q2 2024.  
- Net income was $655 million in Q2 2024, implying a net profit margin around 28%.

o How have these margins trended over recent quarters?
- The net interest margin expanded 7 bps from 3.52% in Q1 2024 but contracted 32 bps from 3.91% in Q2 2023.
- The efficiency ratio improved from 60.8% in Q1 2024 but worsened from 48.9% in Q2 2023.

o Increasing profit margins suggest better cost management or pricing power, while declining margins may indicate rising costs or competitive pressures – does this apply to the company at all?
- The expanding net interest margin suggests M&T was able to reprice its assets faster than liabilities in the rising rate environment, boosting margins. However, the worsening efficiency ratio points to higher expenses outpacing revenues, pressuring operating margins versus the prior year period. This could reflect a combination of rising costs and competitive pressures impacting pricing.

o Has the EPS increased or decreased compared to previous periods?
- Diluted EPS was $3.73 in Q2 2024, up 24% from $3.02 in Q1 2024 but down 26% from $5.05 in Q2 2023.
