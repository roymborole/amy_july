- Gaming revenue was $648 million, down 59% year-over-year, due to lower semi-custom revenue

- Operating income was $269 million versus $20 million operating loss in Q2 2023

Profit margins expanded significantly year-over-year due to the revenue mix shift towards higher margin Data Center sales and operating leverage on higher revenue.

AMD generated strong cash flow and earnings leverage in the quarter from Data Center/Client strength. It returned cash to shareholders through buybacks while paying down debt.

The results show AMD successfully capitalizing on AI/data center demand trends with its newest products, offsetting weakness in client PC and gaming markets. Profitability expanded significantly. However, the outlook depends on sustained Data Center momentum amid economic uncertainty. Management's guidance and commentary on demand indicators will be important.
