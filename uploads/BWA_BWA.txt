{Q2 2024} Macroeconomic Analysis for BorgWarner Inc.

Date: July 31, 2024

o How has the company's revenue changed compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year?

BorgWarner's revenue for Q2 2024 was $3,603 million, a decrease of 2% compared to $3,671 million in Q2 2023. However, compared to Q1 2024 revenue of $3,595 million, revenue increased by $8 million or 0.2%.

o Is the growth in sales driven by volume or price increases? 

The decrease in sales compared to Q2 2023 was primarily driven by a $12 million reduction from lower volume, mix and net new business, partially offset by a $6 million increase from acquisitions. The modest increase compared to Q1 2024 was likely driven by a combination of slightly higher volumes and price increases to offset inflationary pressures.

o Strong revenue growth can indicate rising demand or successful market expansion. Slowing or declining revenue might suggest market saturation or economic downturns – does the above relate to the stock and if so how?

The slight decline in year-over-year revenue does not appear to be a major concern at this point, as it was relatively modest. However, it could potentially signal some softening of demand or market saturation if the trend continues. Investors may view this as a potential headwind for the stock price in the near-term, though BorgWarner's strong positioning in electrification products could help mitigate this risk over the longer-term as EV adoption increases.

o What are the company's gross, operating, and net profit margins?

For Q2 2024:
Gross Profit Margin: 19.0%
Operating Income Margin: 8.2% 
Net Profit Margin: 9.1% (based on net earnings from continuing operations)

o How have these margins trended over recent quarters?

Gross Profit Margin:
Q2 2024: 19.0%
Q1 2024: 17.9%
Q4 2023: 18.2%
Q3 2023: 18.1%

Operating Income Margin: 
Q2 2024: 8.2%
Q1 2024: 8.3%  
Q4 2023: 7.9%
Q3 2023: 8.4%

Net Profit Margin:
Q2 2024: 9.1% 
Q1 2024: 6.2%
Q4 2023: 6.3%  
Q3 2023: 6.9%

The gross and operating margins have shown modest improvement over the past few quarters, while net profit margins have fluctuated more due to one-time items.

o Increasing profit margins suggest better cost management or pricing power, while declining margins may indicate rising costs or competitive pressures – does this apply to the company at all?

The increasing gross profit margins likely indicate a combination of better cost management through restructuring efforts, as well as some ability to pass through price increases to offset inflationary cost pressures. The relatively stable operating margins suggest BorgWarner has been able to keep overhead costs in check as well. So the margin trends do point to reasonably effective cost management and pricing execution by the company so far in dealing with the inflationary environment.

o Has the EPS increased or decreased compared to previous periods?

BorgWarner's diluted EPS from continuing operations was:

Q2 2024: $1.39
Q1 2024: $0.93
Q2 2023: $0.97
Q1 2023: $0.72

So EPS increased 43% year-over-year in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023, and increased 49% sequentially from Q1 2024.

o What are the main areas of CapEx (e.g., expansion, maintenance, technology)?

The company does not provide a detailed breakdown, but the CapEx is likely focused on:

1) Capacity expansion and new product programs to support growth, especially in electrification products

2) Maintenance/replacement CapEx for existing facilities 

3) Investment in new technologies, particularly for electric vehicle components and systems

o What guidance is management providing for the next quarter or year?

BorgWarner has not provided specific quarterly or annual guidance. However, they expect global market production to decrease modestly year-over-year in 2024, but anticipate increased revenue excluding currency impacts due to higher penetration of their products, including eProducts.

o How does this guidance compare to macroeconomic forecasts?

While BorgWarner did not provide a specific revenue guidance number, their expectation of modest global production declines in 2024 is generally in line with forecasts from research firms like IHS Markit and LMC Automotive which project global light vehicle production to decline around 2-4% year-over-year in 2024.

o How is the company performing relative to its peers and the overall industry?

For Q2 2024, BorgWarner's revenue declined 2% year-over-year, while major peers like Magna and Aptiv reported revenue growth of around 10-12%. However, BorgWarner's eProducts revenue grew 14% year-over-year, outpacing the overall industry growth rate for electrification products estimated at around 10% by research firms.

o Are there any sector-specific trends impacting the company (e.g., commodity prices, regulation)?

Some key sector trends impacting BorgWarner include:

1) Commodity price inflation, particularly for metals and plastics used in automotive components

2) Increasing regulatory pressures around emissions and fuel efficiency standards globally, driving demand for BorgWarner's fuel-efficient technologies

3) Accelerating shift towards vehicle electrification driven by regulations and consumer demand

o How is the company exposed to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rates, currency fluctuations, or trade policies?

1) Inflation - Higher input costs from commodity, labor and energy inflation can pressure margins

2) Interest rates - Rising rates increase BorgWarner's borrowing costs on its $3.7 billion of debt

3) Currency fluctuations - As a global company, BorgWarner is exposed to translational FX impacts from currencies like the Euro, Chinese Renminbi, etc.  

4) Trade policies - New tariffs or restrictions could disrupt BorgWarner's global supply chain and raise costs

o What is the impact of the current economic cycle on the company's business model?

The current environment of slowing economic growth and high inflation presents some headwinds for BorgWarner's traditional combustion engine products. However, the secular trend towards vehicle electrification provides a long-term growth opportunity that could offset cyclical pressures. BorgWarner's increasing focus on electrification products positions it well to navigate the cycle.

o What risks has the company highlighted, and how are they being managed?

Key risks highlighted by BorgWarner include:

Supply chain disruptions - Mitigated through multi-sourcing, long-term agreements, safety stock
Commodity cost inflation - Addressed through commercial negotiations to recover costs 
Execution of electrification strategy - Investing heavily in R&D, M&A to build capabilities
Cybersecurity threats - Enhancing security systems and protocols
Regulatory compliance - Robust compliance monitoring and training programs

o How is the company adapting to or capitalizing on macroeconomic changes?

BorgWarner is adapting to macroeconomic shifts like electrification through:

1) Strategic acquisitions to build electrification capabilities (e.g. Drivetek, Hubei Surpass Sun)

2) Increased R&D investment in next-gen electrified propulsion technologies  

3) Restructuring to reduce structural costs in legacy combustion engine business

4) Capital investments in new production capacity for EV components

o What new projects, acquisitions, or partnerships has the company announced? 

Recent acquisitions include:
- Eldor's electric hybrid systems business (Dec 2023) 
- Hubei Surpass Sun's EV charging business (Mar 2023)
- Drivetek AG for power electronics capabilities (Dec 2022)
- Rhombus Energy Solutions' EV charging business (Jul 2022)

BorgWarner has also announced partnerships with companies like Wolfspeed on silicon carbide devices for EV inverters.

o How do these align with the company's long-term strategy?

These acquisitions and partnerships are directly aligned with BorgWarner's "Charging Forward" strategy to aggressively grow its electrification product portfolio through M&A and investments in electric propulsion technologies like inverters, motors, battery systems and charging solutions.

o Has the company maintained, increased, or decreased its dividend payout?

BorgWarner has maintained its quarterly dividend at $0.17 per share through 2023. For 2024, the company has increased its quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share, a 29% increase.

o Is the company engaging in share buybacks?

Yes, in Q2 2024 BorgWarner repurchased $100 million worth of its common stock under its share repurchase program.

o Are there any new regulations or legal challenges affecting the company?

The company has not highlighted any major new regulations or legal issues in its recent filings and disclosures. Existing areas of regulatory focus include emissions standards, fuel economy rules, and trade policies.

o How might these impact future earnings and operations?

Stricter emissions and fuel economy regulations could benefit BorgWarner by driving demand for its fuel-efficient technologies. However, protectionist trade policies that disrupt supply chains or increase costs could pressure margins. Overall regulatory impacts are currently viewed as a modest net positive for BorgWarner.

o What is the company P/E ratio? Is it good or bad?

As of July 31, 2024, BorgWarner's trailing P/E ratio was around 15x based on the current share price and full-year 2023 EPS.

This P/E multiple is relatively low compared to BorgWarner's historical averages and lower than some peers, potentially signaling that the market views the company's growth prospects as more limited or riskier. However, a lower P/E can also indicate value for investors if earnings growth accelerates.

o Did you find anything anomalous – something that isn't what you expected?

A few potential anomalies:

1) The 43% year-over-year increase in Q2 EPS seems high given the modest 2% revenue decline. This could signal very effective cost control and margin expansion efforts.

2) The decision to increase the dividend by 29% for 2024 is somewhat surprising given the slowing economic growth backdrop. It indicates management's confidence in sustained earnings and cash flow generation.

3) The $100 million share repurchase in Q2 was relatively large compared to recent quarters, suggesting a potential shift towards more aggressive capital return to shareholders.

o Did you find anything unusual?

One slightly unusual item was the $15 million commercial contract settlement charge related to the Eldor acquisition. While M&A integration issues can arise, this specific charge was not initially expected or discussed.

o Does the company show any signs of illegal or irregular behavior?

No, based on the information provided in the company's quarterly report and financial statements, there are no overt signs of illegal or irregular behavior by BorgWarner or its management.

o Is there a correlation to performance and stock price?

BorgWarner's stock price has generally tracked the fundamental performance of the business over recent years. Periods of stronger revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings/cash flow have corresponded with higher stock prices, while periods of underperformance have weighed on the shares.

However, the market seems to currently be assigning a relatively lower earnings multiple to BorgWarner compared to history, potentially due to concerns around execution risks with the electrification strategy or the impacts of the slowing economic cycle. Continued strong execution could re-rate the stock higher if the company can sustain solid earnings growth through the cycle.

In summary, this quarterly report portrayed a company navigating the current environment reasonably well, with modest top-line growth offset by effective cost management to drive margin expansion and strong earnings growth. BorgWarner's increasing focus and investments in electrification products also position it to capitalize on that crucial long-term growth opportunity. While economic and execution risks remain, the overall financial performance and positioning appears relatively healthy based on the data provided in this report.
