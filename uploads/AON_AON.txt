Q2 2024 Macroeconomic Analysis for Aon plc

Date: July 26, 2024

Revenue:
- Total revenue increased 18% to $3.76 billion compared to Q2 2023, driven by acquired revenues from the NFP acquisition and 6% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable foreign currency translation impact.
- Commercial Risk Solutions revenue increased 14% to $2.02 billion, with 6% organic growth across major geographies from new business and strong retention. 
- Reinsurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $635 million, with 7% organic growth from new business in treaty and facultative placements.
- Health Solutions revenue increased 48% to $662 million, with acquired NFP revenues and 6% organic growth globally in core health and benefits.
- Wealth Solutions revenue increased 32% to $463 million, with acquired NFP revenues and 9% organic growth in retirement advisory and investments.

Revenue growth was strong, indicating rising demand and successful market expansion through the NFP acquisition and organic growth initiatives. This could positively impact the stock.

Profitability:
- Gross profit margin was 82.6% compared to 73.5% in Q2 2023.
- Operating margin decreased to 17.4% from 26.5% in Q2 2023, due to higher operating expenses from the NFP acquisition and restructuring charges.
- Adjusted operating margin, which excludes certain items, was 27.4% compared to 27.3% in Q2 2023.

While gross margins improved, operating margins declined due to acquisition and restructuring costs, which could pressure profitability in the near-term as Aon integrates NFP. However, the adjusted operating margin was relatively stable.

Earnings:
- Diluted EPS decreased to $2.46 from $2.71 in Q2 2023. 
- Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items, was $2.93 compared to $2.76 in Q2 2023.

While GAAP EPS declined year-over-year, the adjusted EPS metric increased modestly, indicating underlying earnings growth.

Cash Flow:
- Operating cash flow for the first half of 2024 was $822 million, down from $1.13 billion in the prior year period, due to higher receivables, transaction/integration costs, legal expenses, restructuring, and taxes.
- Free cash flow for the first half was $721 million, down from $986 million in the prior year.

Cash flow declined year-over-year due to acquisition-related impacts, restructuring, and legal costs, which could pressure liquidity in the near-term as Aon integrates NFP.

Debt and Liquidity:
- Total debt increased $6.4 billion to $17.6 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to year-end 2023, primarily to fund the NFP acquisition.
- The company issued $6 billion in new senior notes in Q1 2024 and drew $2 billion on a delayed draw term loan.
- Aon repurchased $500 million in shares in the first half of 2024.

Aon took on significant new debt to fund the NFP deal, which increased leverage but the company maintains ample liquidity from its credit facilities. Share repurchases continue utilizing the remaining authorization.

Other Items:
- Aon initiated the Accelerating Aon United restructuring program in Q3 2023 to streamline technology, optimize structure, and reduce real estate footprint, with $251 million in charges in the first half of 2024.
- The company is exposed to foreign currency impacts, with unfavorable translation impacts on revenue and earnings in Q2 2024.
- No significant anomalies or signs of irregular behavior were noted in the results.
- Stock performance will likely correlate with the company's ability to integrate NFP, achieve cost synergies, grow organically, and maintain profitability and cash flow.

In summary, Aon reported strong revenue growth from the NFP acquisition and organic initiatives in Q2 2024, though profitability was impacted by acquisition and restructuring costs. Cash flow declined year-over-year due to acquisition impacts. The company took on debt to fund the NFP deal but maintains liquidity. Execution on integrating NFP, realizing synergies, and managing costs will be key to driving shareholder value.
