Revenue growth was driven by rate increases implemented across several service areas to support capital investments in safety, reliability and system modernization. 

Atmos issued $925 million in new senior notes during the quarter to help fund its ongoing $2.1 billion capital expenditure program for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. The company maintained strong liquidity and financial flexibility.

There were no signs of irregular financial activities or illegal behavior disclosed. Performance metrics like sales volumes, meters in service and operating income growth appeared in line with the company's regulated utility operations.

The company's P/E ratio was not explicitly stated, but based on the quarterly EPS of $1.08 and the June 30, 2024 closing stock price of $124.78 (sourced separately), the trailing P/E ratio was approximately 115x. This relatively high P/E likely reflects the market's view of Atmos as a stable, regulated utility with consistent earnings growth.

Overall, Atmos Energy reported a solid quarter operationally and financially, supporting its strategy of investing in safety and reliability while earning its allowed rates of return. The results appear correlated with the company's stable, regulated utility business model.
