Q3 2024 Macroeconomic Analysis for Cisco Systems, Inc.

Date: May 21, 2024

Revenue:
- Total revenue decreased by 13% year-over-year to $12.7 billion in Q3 2024. 
- Product revenue decreased by 19% to $9.0 billion, while service revenue increased by 6% to $3.7 billion.

The revenue decline was driven by:
- Customers scrutinizing spend and needing additional time to implement elevated product shipments from prior quarters, impacting overall product demand through at least the end of fiscal 2024.
- Declines across all geographic segments - Americas (-15%), EMEA (-9%), and APJC (-12%).
- Within product categories, a 27% decline in Networking revenue was partially offset by growth in Security (+36%), Observability (+27%), and flat performance in Collaboration.

Gross Margin:
- Total gross margin increased by 1.7 percentage points to 65.1%, driven by favorable product mix, productivity improvements, and benefits from the Splunk acquisition, partially offset by pricing erosion.
- Product gross margin increased by 0.8 percentage points to 63.5%.
- Service gross margin increased by 3.8 percentage points due to lower headcount costs and higher volume, partially offset by unfavorable mix.

Operating Expenses:
- Research and development expenses decreased by 1% to $1.9 billion.
- Sales and marketing expenses increased by 1% to $2.6 billion. 
- General and administrative expenses increased by 15% to $736 million, driven by higher acquisition-related costs.

Operating Income:
- Operating income decreased by 44% to $2.2 billion, and operating margin declined by 9.9 percentage points to 17.2%, primarily due to the revenue decrease, higher restructuring charges, and increased amortization of purchased intangible assets.

Other Income/Expense:
- Interest income increased by $149 million due to higher interest rates and cash balances.
- Interest expense increased by $248 million, driven by higher interest rates and debt issuance.
- Other income improved by $132 million, primarily due to lower impairment charges on privately held investments.

Net Income and EPS:
- Net income decreased by 41% to $1.9 billion.
- Diluted earnings per share (EPS) decreased by 41% to $0.46.

The results were impacted by the acquisition of Splunk in March 2024, which contributed $413 million in revenue but a net loss of $212 million in Q3 2024.

Key Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items:
- Cash and cash equivalents and investments were $18.8 billion, down $7.4 billion from July 29, 2023, primarily due to the Splunk acquisition, share repurchases, dividends, and debt repayment, partially offset by debt issuance.
- Remaining performance obligations increased 11% to $38.8 billion, including $3.4 billion from Splunk.
- Total debt was $32.0 billion, up from $8.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2023, due to debt issuance to finance the Splunk acquisition.
- Operating cash flow was $7.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2024.
- Free cash flow was $6.7 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2024.
- Share repurchases were $3.8 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2024.
- Dividends paid were $4.8 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2024.

Overall, Cisco's Q3 2024 results were impacted by macroeconomic factors and customers scrutinizing spend, leading to declines in product revenue and operating income. However, the company saw growth in certain product areas like Security and Observability, driven by the Splunk acquisition. Cisco continues to navigate the challenging environment while investing in key priority areas.
