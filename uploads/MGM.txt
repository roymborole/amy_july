The company did not disclose anything anomalous or indicate signs of illegal/irregular behavior in the results. There appears to be a correlation between the improved operating performance, particularly the ramp up at MGM China, and the increase in stock price during the quarter.

In terms of the stock price movement, it would be helpful to have more specific details on the company's P/E ratio and how it compares to peers/historical levels to assess potential undervaluation or overvaluation of the shares based on the results. But overall, the revenue growth, margin expansion at MGM China, and earnings per share growth seem supportive of the stock's performance in Q2 2024.
