Second Quarter 2024 Macroeconomic Analysis for Assurant, Inc.
Date: August 8, 2024

Revenue Analysis:

o How has the company's revenue changed compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year?
- Net earned premiums increased 4% to $2.44 billion in Q2 2024 from $2.34 billion in Q2 2023, driven by growth in Connected Living from global mobile device protection programs and Homeowners from higher lender-placed policies in-force.
- Fees and other income increased 27% to $375.2 million in Q2 2024 from $295.7 million in Q2 2023, primarily due to contributions from newly launched mobile trade-in programs.

o Is the growth in sales driven by volume or price increases? 
The revenue growth was primarily driven by volume increases, including higher mobile subscribers in Connected Living, new lender-placed insurance programs and portfolios in Homeowners, and contributions from newly launched mobile trade-in programs. There were also some impacts from higher premium rates in Homeowners to address increased claims severity.

o Strong revenue growth can indicate rising demand or successful market expansion. Slowing or declining revenue might suggest market saturation or economic downturns – does the above relate to the stock and if so how?
The strong revenue growth indicates rising demand for Assurant's products and services, particularly in the Connected Living and Homeowners businesses. This successful market expansion could positively impact the stock price. However, the mobile business is subject to volatility based on new device releases and trade-in volumes, which could impact future revenue growth.

Profitability Analysis:  

o What are the company's gross, operating, and net profit margins?
Assurant does not explicitly disclose gross profit, operating profit or net profit margins in its quarterly report. However, some related metrics are:
- Policyholder benefits ratio (benefits/premiums) was 28.5% in Q2 2024 vs 27.0% in Q2 2023
- Expense ratio (underwriting expenses/premiums+fees) was 67.9% in Q2 2024 vs 68.1% in Q2 2023  
- Net income margin (net income/total revenues) was 6.4% in Q2 2024 vs 5.7% in Q2 2023

o How have these margins trended over recent quarters?
The policyholder benefits ratio increased year-over-year, driven by higher non-catastrophe losses in Homeowners and elevated claims costs in Global Automotive from inflation impacts. 
The expense ratio improved slightly year-over-year.
The net income margin improved year-over-year due to lower after-tax losses from non-core operations and a lower effective tax rate.

o Increasing profit margins suggest better cost management or pricing power, while declining margins may indicate rising costs or competitive pressures – does this apply to the company at all?
The increasing net income margin suggests Assurant was able to better manage costs and pricing relative to rising claims costs and inflation pressures compared to the prior year quarter. However, the higher policyholder benefits ratio indicates the company faced rising claims costs that outpaced premium growth.
