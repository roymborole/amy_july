How has the company's revenue changed compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year?
Conagra's revenue in Q3 FY2024 was $3,032.9 million, down 1.7% from $3,086.5 million in Q3 FY2023. Compared to the prior quarter (Q2 FY2024), revenue decreased 2.8% from $3,116.3 million.

Is the growth (decline) in sales driven by volume or price/mix increases (decreases)?
The year-over-year decline in Q3 revenue was primarily driven by lower volumes across the Refrigerated & Frozen and Foodservice segments, partially offset by higher pricing and favorable brand mix in the Grocery & Snacks and International segments.

Strong revenue growth can indicate rising demand or successful market expansion. Slowing or declining revenue might suggest market saturation or economic downturns. Does the above relate to the company and if so how?
Conagra's declining revenue appears to be driven primarily by lower consumer demand and consumption trends seen across the industry, rather than market saturation. The company cited continued consumer behavior shifts and economic pressures impacting volumes. However, Conagra did see revenue growth in its Grocery & Snacks and International segments, suggesting successful pricing actions and brand performance in those areas.

What are the company's gross, operating, and net profit margins? 
Specific profit margin figures were not provided, but some insights:

- Overall gross profit increased year-over-year, driven by productivity, lower costs, and reduced inventory write-offs, despite the impact of lower sales, input cost inflation, and unfavorable operating leverage.

- Operating profit of $578.4 million represented an operating profit margin of around 19.1% based on the revenue of $3,032.9 million. 

- Net income was $308.8 million in the quarter.

How have these margins trended over recent quarters?
Margin details were not provided for multiple quarters to analyze trends. However, some factors that impacted year-over-year gross profit and operating profit changes were noted.

Increasing profit margins suggest better cost management or pricing power, while declining margins may indicate rising costs or competitive pressures. Does this apply to the company at all?
The increase in Conagra's overall gross profit appears to reflect successful productivity efforts, cost management on transportation/inventory, and pricing actions to offset input cost inflation and unfavorable operating leverage from lower volumes. This suggests the company was able to leverage pricing power and cost controls to protect margins despite the challenging operating environment. However, without detailed margin figures it's difficult to fully assess the impact.
