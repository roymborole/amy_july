{Second Quarter 2024} Macroeconomic Analysis for The Cigna Group

Date: August 1, 2024

o How has the company's revenue changed compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year?
For the three months ended June 30, 2024, The Cigna Group's total revenues increased 25% to $60.5 billion compared to $48.6 billion in the same quarter last year. Compared to the first quarter of 2024, total revenues increased 10% from $57.3 billion.

o Is the growth in sales driven by volume or price increases? 
The growth in revenues was primarily driven by higher volume across the company's businesses. Specifically, pharmacy revenues increased 33% year-over-year to $45.1 billion, reflecting higher claims volume driven by new clients, including Centene Corporation, and organic growth in the Evernorth Health Services segment. Premiums increased 4% to $11.5 billion, reflecting higher premium rates in the Cigna Healthcare segment due to expected increases in underlying medical costs, partially offset by business mix changes.

o Strong revenue growth can indicate rising demand or successful market expansion. Slowing or declining revenue might suggest market saturation or economic downturns – does the above relate to the stock and if so how?
The Cigna Group's strong revenue growth in the second quarter of 2024 indicates rising demand for its products and services, as well as successful market expansion through new client acquisitions and organic growth. This robust top-line performance is generally viewed positively by investors and can support the company's stock price. However, investors will also closely examine the company's profitability metrics and outlook to assess the sustainability and quality of the revenue growth.

o What are the company's gross, operating, and net profit margins?
The Cigna Group does not explicitly disclose gross profit margin in its financial statements. However, based on the information provided, the following profit margins can be calculated:

Operating profit margin = Income from operations / Total revenues
= $2,412 million / $60,523 million = 4.0% 

Net profit margin = Shareholders' net income / Total revenues  
= $1,548 million / $60,523 million = 2.6%

o How have these margins trended over recent quarters?
The company does not provide detailed historical data on profit margins in its quarterly reports. However, based on the year-over-year comparisons, the operating profit margin of 4.0% in Q2 2024 appears to be an improvement compared to the prior year period. The net profit margin of 2.6% in Q2 2024 is lower than the 3.0% reported in Q2 2023 ($1,460 million net income / $48,586 million total revenues).

o Increasing profit margins suggest better cost management or pricing power, while declining margins may indicate rising costs or competitive pressures – does this apply to the company at all?
The improvement in operating profit margin suggests that The Cigna Group has been effective in managing costs and potentially benefiting from pricing power or operating leverage as revenues grow. However, the decline in net profit margin indicates that factors such as investment losses or other non-operating expenses may have offset some of the operating profitability gains in the most recent quarter.

o Has the EPS increased or decreased compared to previous periods?
The Cigna Group reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.45 for the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 11% compared to $4.92 in the same quarter last year. However, for the six months ended June 30, 2024, diluted EPS decreased 52% to $4.43 compared to $9.15 in the prior year period.
