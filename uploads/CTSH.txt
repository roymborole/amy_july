Management Discussion and Analysis:

o How has the company's revenue changed compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year?
Revenues decreased by $36 million or 0.7% compared to Q2 2023, representing a decrease of 0.5% on a constant currency basis. Recently completed acquisitions contributed 60 basis points to revenue growth.

o Is the growth in sales driven by volume or price increases?
The decline in revenues was primarily driven by reduced demand for discretionary work across segments, particularly in the Financial Services and Products and Resources segments, partially offset by revenue growth from acquisitions and resale of third-party products.

o Strong revenue growth can indicate rising demand or successful market expansion. Slowing or declining revenue might suggest market saturation or economic downturns – does the above relate to the stock and if so how?
The slowing revenue growth appears to be related to reduced client demand for discretionary projects amidst economic uncertainty, rather than market saturation. The company's ability to maintain revenue levels through acquisitions and integrated offerings suggests it is adapting its strategy to changing market conditions.

o What are the company's gross, operating, and net profit margins? 
- Gross margin: Not explicitly stated, but cost of revenues was 66.1% of revenues

- Adjusted Operating Margin: 15.2%
- Net profit margin: 11.7%

o How have these margins trended over recent quarters?
The operating margin increased by 280 basis points compared to Q2 2023, driven by savings from the NextGen program and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by an insurance recovery benefit in Q2 2023. The Adjusted Operating Margin increased by 100 basis points.

o Increasing profit margins suggest better cost management or pricing power, while declining margins may indicate rising costs or competitive pressures – does this apply to the company at all?
The increasing operating margins suggest effective cost management through the NextGen program and currency tailwinds, offsetting competitive pricing pressures.

o Has the EPS increased or decreased compared to previous periods?
Diluted EPS increased by $0.23 or 25.3% compared to Q2 2023.
