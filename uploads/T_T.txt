Q2 2024 Macroeconomic Analysis for AT&T Inc.
Date: July 25, 2024

Revenue Changes:

o How has the company's revenue changed compared to the previous quarter and the same quarter last year?
- Total operating revenues decreased 0.4% in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023, from $29,917 million to $29,797 million.
- Compared to Q1 2024, total operating revenues increased 3.9% from $30,028 million.
- Service revenues increased 0.6% year-over-year driven by growth in Mobility and Consumer Wireline, partially offset by declines in Business Wireline.
- Equipment revenues decreased 5.4% year-over-year due to lower wireless sales volumes.

o Is the growth in sales driven by volume or price increases? 
- Revenue growth was primarily driven by subscriber gains and higher ARPU (average revenue per user) in the Mobility business from pricing actions, as well as an increase in higher-ARPU fiber broadband customers in the Consumer Wireline business. This indicates a combination of volume and pricing factors driving the growth.

o Strong revenue growth can indicate rising demand or successful market expansion. Slowing or declining revenue might suggest market saturation or economic downturns – does the above relate to the stock and if so how?
- AT&T's relatively flat overall revenues do not indicate strong rising demand or market expansion, but rather a maturing market. The revenue declines in legacy Business Wireline services suggest some market saturation, offset by growth in strategic areas like wireless and fiber broadband. 
- The stock has been relatively flat year-to-date, perhaps reflecting the lack of strong top-line growth momentum. Continued execution on strategic initiatives like 5G and fiber could drive future revenue and stock appreciation if successful.

Profitability:

o What are the company's gross, operating, and net profit margins?
- AT&T does not report gross profit margins, but its operating income margin was 19.3% in Q2 2024 versus 21.4% in Q2 2023.
- Net income margin was 13.3% in Q2 2024 versus 15.9% in Q2 2023.

o How have these margins trended over recent quarters?
- Operating income margin decreased from 20.7% in the first half of 2023 to 19.4% in the first half of 2024.
- Net income margin decreased from 15.4% in the first half of 2023 to 12.9% in the first half of 2024.

o Increasing profit margins suggest better cost management or pricing power, while declining margins may indicate rising costs or competitive pressures – does this apply to the company at all?
- AT&T's declining profit margins indicate a combination of rising costs (e.g. $480 million restructuring charge in Q2 2024 related to network modernization) and competitive pressures in legacy businesses like wireline voice. However, margins in the strategic Mobility business have been increasing, suggesting AT&T is gaining some pricing power as it deploys 5G.

Earnings:

o Has the EPS increased or decreased compared to previous periods?
- Diluted EPS decreased 19.4% year-over-year from $1.19 in the first half of 2023 to $0.96 in the first half of 2024.

o How does this guidance compare to macroeconomic forecasts?
- No guidance provided to compare to macroeconomic forecasts.

Competitive Position: 

o How is the company performing relative to its peers and the overall industry?
- AT&T is one of the leading telecom providers but faces intense competition from peers like Verizon and T-Mobile in the wireless market and cable companies like Comcast in broadband.
- Its wireless service revenue growth of 3.3% year-over-year outpaced the industry average of around 2%.
- However, its legacy wireline voice business continues to face secular declines.

o Are there any sector-specific trends impacting the company (e.g., commodity prices, regulation)?
- The telecom sector is being impacted by the ongoing deployment of 5G technology, which requires significant capital investment.
- Regulation around issues like net neutrality, spectrum auctions, and digital discrimination rules create uncertainty.

Macro Exposures:

o How is the company exposed to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rates, currency fluctuations, or trade policies?
- Rising inflation is pressuring AT&T's costs, though it has some ability to pass through price increases.
- Higher interest rates increase the company's borrowing costs on its $130 billion debt load.
- Currency fluctuations have a modest impact given AT&T's primarily U.S.-based operations.
- Trade policies like tariffs could impact the costs of network equipment from foreign suppliers.

o What is the impact of the current economic cycle on the company's business model?
- In an economic downturn, AT&T's wireless services may see lower consumer demand for premium plans and device upgrades.
- However, its broadband and enterprise connectivity services could benefit as more activity shifts online.

Risks and Outlook:

o What risks has the company highlighted, and how are they being managed?
- Key risks include competition, technological substitution, regulatory/legal challenges, system failures, and natural disasters.

Other Considerations:  

o Are there any new regulations or legal challenges affecting the company?
- The FCC's new net neutrality and digital discrimination rules create potential regulatory risks around broadband pricing and deployment.
- AT&T and trade groups have challenged the FCC's rules in court.

o How might these impact future earnings and operations?
- Adverse rulings could restrict AT&T's pricing and operating flexibility for broadband services.

o What is the company's P/E ratio? Is it good or bad?
- AT&T's P/E ratio is around 7x based on the current stock price, which is relatively low compared to historical levels and peers.
- This could signal an undervalued stock, or concerns around the company's growth prospects.

o Did you find anything anomalous – something that isn't what you expected?

o Did you find anything unusual? 
- The $480 million restructuring charge related to network modernization was an unusual item impacting Q2 results.

o Does the company show any signs of illegal or irregular behavior?
- No signs of illegal or irregular behavior identified in the Q2 report.

o Is there a correlation to performance and stock price?
- AT&T's stock price has been relatively flat year-to-date, perhaps reflecting the lack of strong revenue/profit growth momentum despite pockets of success like wireless.
