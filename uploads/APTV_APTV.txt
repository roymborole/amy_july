Q2 2024 Macroeconomic Analysis for Aptiv PLC

Date: August 1, 2024

Revenue:
- Net sales for Q2 2024 were $5,051 million, down 3% compared to Q2 2023
- Volumes decreased 3% in Q2 2024, reflecting declines primarily in Europe and North America, with flat global automotive production (down 1% on an Aptiv weighted market basis)
- Unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $42 million, primarily related to the Chinese Yuan Renminbi and Euro
- Favorable pricing, net of contractual price reductions, of $55 million partially offset volume declines

For the six months ended June 30, 2024:
- Net sales were $9,952 million, down 1% year-over-year
- Volumes decreased 1%, reflecting declines primarily in Europe
- Unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $65 million
- Favorable pricing, net of contractual price reductions, of $98 million

The sales decline indicates some softening demand or market saturation, potentially related to economic conditions impacting automotive production and sales in certain regions like Europe. However, the company was able to partially offset volume declines through pricing actions.

Profitability:
Gross Margin
- Q2 2024 gross margin was 19.2%, up from 16.6% in Q2 2023
- Improvement driven by operational performance of $133 million

For six months ended June 30, 2024:  
- Gross margin was 18.5%, up from 16.2% in the prior year period
- Operational performance contributed $229 million to higher margins

The significant gross margin expansion indicates successful cost management and pricing power, helping offset volume pressures.

Operating Income
- Q2 2024 operating income was $441 million, up from $410 million in Q2 2023
- Benefited from improved gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A, restructuring, and other costs

For six months:
- Operating income of $860 million, up from $758 million in the prior year  
- In addition to gross margin drivers, lower amortization expense provided a benefit

The increase in operating income, despite modest sales declines, suggests Aptiv was able to leverage its operating structure and implement cost controls effectively in the current environment.

EPS
- Q2 2024 diluted EPS of $3.47, up significantly from $0.84 in Q2 2023
- Increase primarily driven by a $641 million gain on Motional transactions in Q2 2024

For six months:
- Diluted EPS of $4.24, up from $1.38 in the prior year period
- Gain on Motional transactions was the key driver of the year-over-year increase

The large gain related to restructuring Aptiv's ownership in the Motional autonomous driving joint venture provided a significant boost to earnings in Q2 and the first half of 2024.

Cash Flow:
- Operating cash flow of $887 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, up from $526 million in the prior year
- Increase driven by higher net earnings and lower working capital requirements

The strong cash flow performance indicates Aptiv was able to effectively manage working capital and convert earnings to cash despite the modest sales decline.

Balance Sheet/Capital Deployment:
- Cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2024
- Total debt of $7.0 billion; net debt of $5.6 billion
- Repurchased $1.0 billion of ordinary shares in the first half of 2024
- Announced new $5 billion share repurchase program in July 2024
- Entered $3 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement in August 2024, funded by cash and new debt

Aptiv maintains a solid cash position and overall liquidity to fund operations and shareholder returns. The significant share repurchase activity demonstrates the company's commitment to returning capital to shareholders.

Other Key Points:

- Global inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, including semiconductor shortages, continue impacting operations and costs
- Exposure to geopolitical risks and trade policies due to global manufacturing footprint 
- Investing in software, electrification and autonomous driving capabilities to align with industry technology trends
- No significant debt maturities until 2025; debt largely fixed-rate limiting interest rate exposure

Overall, Aptiv demonstrated operational resilience in Q2 2024 amid modest sales declines. Profitability expanded through cost controls and pricing actions. The Motional transaction provided an earnings boost, while strong cash flow enabled significant shareholder returns through share repurchases. However, the company continues facing industry headwinds from inflation, supply chain constraints and economic uncertainty that could impact future performance. Aptiv's strategic technology investments and global diversification position it to capitalize on key automotive megatrends going forward.
