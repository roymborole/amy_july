South African rugby has a new spirit animal: the Paarl Powerhouse. This tiny Western Cape town is dominating the national team faster than Cheslin Kolbe on a sidestep. Think I'm joking? The stats are so wild, they'll make you spit out your Mageu! Welcome to the most lopsided talent factory in sports history.\nLet's play a game. I'm gonna offer you a R100 bet. The bet is simple: I'll bet you R100 that the next Springbok to earn a test cap will be schooled in Paarl. Let's take it one step further - I'll bet you R1000 that the next Springbok to earn a cap will be schooled in the Western Cape.\nYou might think these are bold predictions, but the data tells a different story altogether. In the Rassie Erasmus Era from 2018-2024, there is a 50% likelihood that a Springbok will be schooled in the Western Cape and a 35% likelihood that they'll be from Paarl.\nThe Western Cape, and Paarl in particular, have a disproportionate representation of Springboks and seem to have cracked the code for producing national team players. Representing only 0.2% of the national population, this small leafy town provides 31% of all the current Springboks, including stars like Handré Pollard and Steven Kitshoff.\nTo truly grasp how prolific Paarl is at producing World Cup winners, consider this for a second: A person from Paarl is 148.81 times more likely to become a Springbok compared to the average South African, and a student from a top Paarl school is 15.625 times more likely to become a Springbok compared to students from other top 100 Rugby schools.\nWhat makes this even more absurd is that Paarl only has two schools in the top 5 national rankings, and each one currently has 3 current Springboks. Paarl Gimnasium, for instance, produced Johan Grobbelaar and Evan Roos, while Paarl Boys' High School is the alma mater of Thomas du Toit and Frans Malherbe. When you extend this out to the rest of the Winelands and the Western Cape, the numbers get even crazier: Even though the Western Cape represents only 12% of the national population, 46% of the current Springboks were schooled in the Western Cape. Of the top 20 schools in SA, 5 are from the Western Cape, and number 1, Paul Roos Gymnasium, is currently a prolific producer, with 6 Springboks, including Damian Willemse and Willie le Roux, calling the Burgundy and Gold their alma mater.\nThe future\nDamian Markus, Jurenzo Julous, Hakeem Kunene, JC Mars \nOpinion: the reason Lukhayo Am is still a Springbok and didnt go the way of Gcobani Bobo running away to emakhaya is because institutional knowledge is now scaling at a rapid rate.\nSA School dominance over 3 years \nLuan Gilomee unbeaten charlie hofmeyer \nhttps://nextgenxv.com/2024/02/08/south-african-schools-team-of-the-decade-so-far/\n\nSo how do they do it?\n\nWell as the saying goes, the devil is in Apartheid, i mean the details. Firstly, 85.7% of all coloured players in the Springbok squad are from the Western Cape, and half of all coloured Springboks hail specifically from Paarl. Secondly, it's crucial to note that the Western Cape's contribution to the squad is equally split between white and coloured players (12 each). This points to the obvious: the infrastructure for growing wine in Paarl is as potent as the infrastructure for transforming talent. The data suggests that the Western Cape, and Paarl in particular, have created a rugby ecosystem that is exceptionally effective at developing players, especially coloured players, to the Springbok level.\nThis suggests that Paarl has become akin to the banlieues (the low income neighborhoods that produced Mbappe, Zidane and Cmavinga) in Paris - hyper-competitive landscapes with asymmetric outcomes that favor winner-take-all scenarios.\nWhat’s wrong with that?\nIt depends on your perspective, if your desire and intent is to watch intoxicating rugby that takes you to Nirvana, then who cares where the magic comes from as long as it’s magic. However if you believe in Holistic thinking then the obvious reality becomes really clear: Paarl and the Western Cape may be exceptional at producing tealemt in all hues, but they’re definitely not producing all the available talent we have on offer. Meaning as good as the Springboks are - and back to back world cups is damn good - they could be much better if we manifested the same conditions we have in Paarl in small towns across the country.\nIn summation, as a fan and admirer of the famed statesman Deng Xiaoping, I must reference his famous quote “Black Cat, white cat, Who cares? As long as it can catch mice, it is a good cat”. In this context I'm not too concerned about the origins of a Springbok player as long as he brings the same magic to the field that has the nation currently transfixed with the men in green and gold. Do the ends justify the means? Of course not, but this is sport, we cannot see it objectively only with rose tinted glasses marveling at the likes of Kurt-lee Arendse and Damian WIllemse carving up the opposition with effortless grace.\n\n” My 2c on that matter is simpleI must stress that i’m a fan of the Lee Yuan \nColour of the Cat \nWell simply put we’re maximizing the talent in Paarl, but not in the rest of the country. Meaning that we inadvertently have created a new barrier to sporting success. Instead of simply working hard and having your talent is identified, over time parents and students alike will flock to the small town to try give their children the best shot at becoming a Pro and right now that shot is moving to the Western Cape and enrolling in a school in the winelands or a major government school ala SACS and Rondebosch. A luxury very few can afford.\nA small wine producing town has quietly become the biggest sports academy on the planet, begging the question “Can other towns’/provinces manifest the same outcomes?”  “Is Paarl special? Or are we simply witnessing a golden generation?”\n\nThe only parallels we can draw are with Football academies in France and the UK, where immigrant children bet the house on climbing the football ladder to the pinnacle. Both systems like the Paarl Supremacy Era produce wonderful outcomes, but the manner in which they do them is highly problematic. \nProblems aside like the Gaokao {Chinese Version of the SAT’s/Matric} the system may be problematic, but ultimately there is an element of fairness in that whether you come from the illustrious Paul Roos (Damian Willemse)  or a little school Paulus Jacobus (Kurt-Lee Arendse), it seems as if the system gives little concern to a player’s background as long as he can produce the proverbial goods. \nDo the ends justify the means? Of course not, but this is sport, we cannot see it objectively only with rose tinted glasses marveling at the likes of Kurt-lee Arendse and Damian WIllemse carving up the opposition with effortless grace.\n\nThe conclusion suggests that for the first time in South African and Western Cape history, we are truly exploiting all the talent available and not allowing race to play a predominant role in selection.\nThe Paarl factory indicates that young coloured kids are being placed in infrastructure that fully exploits their talents, and there is a sincere belief that kids coming from lower-income families and poor communities in the area are betting the proverbial house on young men in their community finding success in the green and gold.\nThis means that as much as we celebrate the diversity of the Springbok era, like most great innovations of the 21st century - cf. the smartphone and cobalt mining in the Congo - the origin is usually darker than we think. So yes, the rainbow nation is finally living up to its promise, but just remember: the participants essentially have to go through a pseudo Hunger Games to make it onto South Africa's biggest stage.\nWhich begs the question: Is there any team in global sports as dominant as the Springboks, the French national football team, or the US men's basketball team that doesn't subscribe to extreme youth development programs? These programs undoubtedly provide us with the world's greatest athletes, but at what cost? Are we putting children through proverbial meat grinders to find exceptional talent? And if so, is the price of sporting excellence too high when it comes at the expense of countless young aspirants' well-being?\nMy DSTV Subscription says “Yes”.

To be clear, i’m not for a second suggesting that Spotify isnt a real streaming service. They are a streaming service, they are a listed company, they do make billion in revenue. However they are not what they say they are and the further and deeper you down their remarkable growth story the more the math isnt mathing.\n\nI’m quite confident that Spotify is the Matrix or they’re some appendage of the all encompassing simulating technology that creates our world. Like Coca-Cola or McDonalds they seem to be everywhere, but unlike Coca-Cola and McDonalds as a millennial one cannot escape them.\nEveryone is on Spotify and the numbers prove that, with over 615 million users globally and 215 million paying users. My fears that they’re everywhere are founded in some logic and truth.\n\nIt’s wild to think that the all encompassing music and software behemoth is only 18 years old. Over two decades my third favorite bald white villain Daniel Ek has built Spotify from a  pipe dream to the nuggets streaming service on planet earth. Through relentless expansion and constant market disruption Ek and his minions built the Swedish Startup into the ultimate disrupter, challenging traditional music consumption models, forcing record labels to adapt to the streaming era, and changing the way artists connect with their audiences.\n\nIt seems Ek and his team can do anything, except establish how to grow their company ina profitable manner….\n\nLike the parent of any toddler will tell you, growth only tells half the story. Despite its impressive growth and market dominance, there’s no clear path to sustainable profitability.\nWhich leads us to the literal Trillion dollar question: Can Spotify transform its undeniable popularity and market leadership into a sustainable, profitable business model?\nOr will the company's growth-at-all-costs strategy prove to be its Achilles' heel, leaving it vulnerable in an increasingly competitive landscape?\n\nLet’s dive into the numbers and unpack how their growth story is only half the story.\n\n- Current (2024) Premium Subscribers: 246 million\n- Year-over-year growth: An impressive 12%\n- Historical trend: From 155 million in 2020 to 246 million in 2024\n- Revenue: €15.2B\n- Market Capitalization: €67.75B\n\nBefore I break down the best sounding scam of 2024, I need to give a few shout outs to Danile Ek and the team. Over 4 years they’ve added 91 million users. 91 Million!\nThat is the equivalent of the entire population of Germany, added to their subscriber base in half a decade. Okay back to the numbers.\nThey’ve been on one hell of a tear and their ability to manifest a CAGR of 12% is nothing short of spectacular. You’d think because the streaming market is relatively mature that growth would slow, but no. This is Spotify, they grow like Swedish Powerlifters.What makes this wilder is that this suggests not only successful retention of existing users but also continued penetration into new markets and demographics.\n\nThe historical trend from 2020 to 2024 paints a picture of consistent, robust growth:\n\n- 2020: 155 million\n- 2021: Approximately 180 million (estimated)\n- 2022: Approximately 205 million (estimated)\n- 2023: Approximately 220 million (estimated)\n- 2024: 246 million\n\nThis steady upward march demonstrates Spotify's ability to scale its platform and attract new users year after year. It's a testament to the company's product appeal, marketing prowess, and ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences.\n\nThe company's user base expansion is undoubtedly a feather in its cap, but it's also a double-edged sword. Each new user brings not just potential revenue, but also costs – in content acquisition, infrastructure scaling, and customer support. As we peel back the layers of Spotify's financials, we'll see how this growth, while impressive on paper, has created a complex web of financial challenges that the company must navigate.\n\nSpotify's financial journey presents a compelling narrative of explosive growth coupled with persistent profitability challenges. The company's revenue has surged impressively, nearly doubling from €7.88 billion in 2020 to €15.2 billion in 2024, representing a robust 15% year-over-year growth. This revenue expansion underscores Spotify's ability to monetize its growing user base and capitalize on the booming streaming market. However, this growth comes at a significant cost. While specific content acquisition costs aren't provided, the company's total expenses of $13.693 billion in 2024 slightly outpaced its operating revenue of $13.247 billion, indicating the substantial financial outlays required to fuel Spotify's expansion.\n\nThe profitability puzzle becomes even more intriguing when examining Spotify's bottom line. The company has navigated a path from consistent losses — with net income deficits of €581 million in 2020 and €532 million in 2023 — to a notable turnaround in 2024, posting a net income of €274 million. This shift to profitability is further emphasized by an operating income of €266 million, translating to a 7.0% margin. Gross margin improvements have been steady, rising from 25.6% in 2020 to 29.2% in 2024, with a significant year-over-year increase of 270 basis points. Despite these positive trends, the market's perception of Spotify appears to be running ahead of its financial reality. With a current stock price of $337.38, a year-to-date performance of 78.70% (far outpacing the S&P 500's 17.11%), and a staggering P/E ratio of 134.95, there's a palpable disconnect between Spotify's valuation and its profitability. This disparity is further highlighted by the company's substantial market capitalization of $67.75 billion, which seems to be pricing in expectations of continued high growth and margin improvements that are yet to be consistently realized.\n\nSpotify's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands as a monument to market irrationality, a numeral so detached from financial reality it might as well be science fiction. At a jaw-dropping 134.95, Spotify's P/E ratio isn't just high—it's stratospheric. To put this in perspective, this means investors are willing to pay nearly $135 for every single dollar of Spotify's earnings. This valuation exists in a realm of optimism so extreme it borders on delusion, especially when you consider that Spotify only recently clawed its way to profitability after years of bleeding red ink. The company's net income of €274 million in 2024, while a welcome change from previous losses, is a mere drop in the ocean compared to its market cap of $67.75 billion. Adding to this financial fever dream is Spotify's share price of $337.38, which has skyrocketed 78.70% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500 by nearly five times. This price surge seems to be fueled more by speculative fervor than by any rational assessment of Spotify's financial health. It's as if the market has collectively decided that the laws of financial gravity don't apply to Spotify, valuing it like a high-growth tech darling while its balance sheet tells a far more sobering story. In the grand theater of tech stocks, Spotify's P/E ratio is performing a high-wire act without a safety net, leaving prudent investors to wonder not if, but when, reality will assert itself.\n\nSo they’re growing but so are their costs and they’ve managed to get to profitability, but they haven't sustained it and their operational costs are still sky high. Which makes them sound a lot like an American Ride-hailing business that grew exponentially and then realized they had to change their model to ever reach profitability.\nExcept unlike Uber it seems like Spotify Investors dont give an F.\nAt first glance my conspiracy theory spidey sense said that Spotify’s growth is off the back of tremendous growth of SAAB and SAAB bulls are pouring all their dividends into Spotify to increase its share price. Which is absurd And almost impossible to prove, but i’m quite confident that Someone at Hindenburg will prove this.\n\nSo you’re growing quickly, your stock is super valuable and your path to sustainable profitability isn't clear. What’s Daniel Ek and the team to do?\nOutside of praying for an actual deux ex machina they need to diversify into something else altogether. Yeah they're getting into audiobooks and podcasts. But I'm not convinced that’s it.\nAI Content will probably happen, but there’s a cannibalization in that, which may result in them killing the platform for artists which in turn pushes users away.\nWhatever they do, a solution should be sought out soon as there's a trillion dollar electronics and software behemoth quietly stalking them who will probably make some kind of hardware play to provide a superior experience to what Spotify has to offer.\n\nWhatever they do they don't have a lot of money to do it, they’re profitable, but x euros is nowhere near enough R&D spend to out innovate the boys from Cupertino. The more likely outcome is that they use this absurd market valuation to buy a ton of electronics startups and utilize that new tech and distribute it to their 600 million users. Either way things aren't looking good for the men in green and black.\n\nI’m not a betting man. Okay’s that a lie. I sure as shit am. But my money is 100% against Spotify. I give them complete praise for their remarkable journey and growth story.\nHowever I don't see them using so little money [] to find a solution to bolster their margins and distribution costs outside of an acquisition and whatever acquisition they may seek out Apple will offer far more to the potential startup if it truly has something compelling.\nLeaving Spotify with the rocket ship problem.\nA rocket ship requires rocket fuel to go up, the bigger the ship the more rocket fuel it requires. Rocket fuel weighs a lot, so the rocket needs to lift itself and the rocket fuel at the same time.\nBut there’s a threshold wherein the more fuel you add to propel a rocket the harder it is to get off the ground. Spotify is a massive rocket and it’s using massive amounts of fuel $13.693 billion to be exact. The more it grows the more it needs, But sooner or later it will require so much fuel it won't be able to get off the ground and therein lies the rub.\n\nUnless Mr. Ek et al can establish a way to build a space elevator or a skyhook, they’re doomed to continue growing to a point wherein they cannot grow anymore. And their high acquisition and infrastructure costs leave them without room for R&D and continued marketing.\nThey’re a brilliant company, but a doomed company.\nI'm short.\n"}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"gpifwsojf6z9"}},"id":"3vZkKE1MUuM4JYQpCJir0x","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-09-06T08:27:49.729Z","updatedAt":"2024-09-06T13:12:06.387Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"article"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"short_text":"Bulletproof Profits: Rheinmetall AG's Explosive 3-Year Surge","long_text":"Former Amazon CEO and professional Lex Luthor Cosplayer Jeff Bezos has a famous saying “Instead of asking what will change, ask what won't change”.

Daddy Putin’s pet war has transformed Europe’s 5th biggest arms manufacturer into a Super stock that is on a generational tear that isn't and won't slow down anytime soon. Okay it’s a bit more complex than Putin wrecking the global economy with his dick measuring war, but that’s been the engine of their tremendous growth.\nThe nitty gritty - just how much have they grown since the beginning of the Ukraine war?\n​​Rheinmetall has demonstrated bonkers performance over the past three years, significantly outpacing the market. While the S&P 500 gained 26.95% over this period, Rheinmetall's stock price surged by an impressive 570.03%, rising from €79.56 to €563.20 per share. \nIn simple English:  Over the three-year period, Rheinmetall AG's stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by a staggering 543.08 percentage points. In other words, Rheinmetall's growth was 21.15 times greater than that of the broader market as represented by the S&P 500. 21 times! This dramatic increase has been backed by robust financial results. In the first half of 2024, the company reported a 33% year-over-year increase in sales to €3.8 billion, with operating revenue reaching €7.176 billion. The operating result jumped 91% to €404 million, driving the operating margin up to 10.6%. Earnings per share (EPS) from ongoing operations improved from €2.53 to €4.21. Rheinmetall's market capitalization has grown to €24.22 billion, reflecting its increased prominence in the defense sector. Perhaps most notably, the company's backlog has swelled to a record €48.6 billion, providing a strong foundation for future growth. These figures underscore Rheinmetall's transformation into a major player in the global defense industry, with financial performance that has consistently exceeded market expectations.\n\nTechnical Analysis\nDiving into the technical indicators, Rheinmetall's stock is painting a picture of robust momentum with a hint of caution. The current share price of €558.00 is comfortably outpacing both its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of €501.23 and its 200-day SMA of €424.58, signaling a strong uptrend that's been gaining steam. This positioning above both key moving averages suggests that bulls are firmly in control, with both short-term and long-term trends pointing skyward. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is waving a yellow flag at 82.31, well into overbought territory. This elevated RSI indicates that the stock might be due for a breather, potentially offering investors a chance to buy on any dips. Adding another layer to this technical tapestry, the stock price has pierced the upper Bollinger Band (€552.07), further confirming the overbought condition. This breach of the upper band, coupled with the wide gap between the upper (€552.07) and lower (€454.52) bands, paints a picture of high volatility and overwhelmingly positive investor sentiment. While these indicators collectively scream \"strong uptrend,\" they also whisper a word of caution about potential short-term overextension.\n\n__\n\nWhy now and where to from here?\n\nThere are a number of factors driving Rheinmettal’s growth, the Ukraine War, DoanlD Trump threatening to cut defense funding for NATO, and the war in Israel/Palestine. However the biggest driver is the future and the past. Let’s start with the past. NATO European parties when NATO was formed agreed to spend x% of GDP every year on defense funding and NATO, like your best mate at dinner, seems to have forgotten about this commitment and the last 15 years most countries, if not all, have failed to consistently live up to this promise. Resulting in almost all of Europes’ armies being underfunded and under-resourced. Now in the wake of hyper Russian aggression and Trump stating he may pull the USA out of NATO, everyone is scrambling to sure up their army and military and Rheinmetall is the proverbial candy shop where all these governments will buy their sweets.\n\nWill this spending continue? Probably.\nWill it continue to be handled by Rheinmetall? This isn't guaranteed but my God are they looking good.\n\nIn 2024 alone they’ve managed the following:\nRheinmetall Nomination revenue (Rheinmetall Nomination comprises incoming orders as well as future call-offs entered into with military customers and new contracts with civilian clients (nominations).) more than doubled to €15.376 billion in H1 2024, up from €7.192 billion in the previous year.\nTheir  backlog has reached a new high of €48.6 billion as of June 30, 2024, a 62% increase from €30.0 billion in the previous year.\nVehicle Systems saw a 28% sales increase to €1.3 billion, with a backlog growth of 31% to €18.148 billion.\n\nWeapon and Ammunition experienced a staggering 93% sales growth to €1.054 billion, with its backlog more than tripling to €19 billion.\nElectronic Solutions increased sales by 28% to €647 million, with orders quadrupling to €3.020 billion.\n\nThey just keep winning and this is reflected in their stock price. And this is not including the recent  acquisition of Loc Performance Products in the USA - this acquisition opens up potential contracts worth over USD 60 billion from the US Government (More Money!).\n\nThey’re diversified, they’re growing faster than every single AI stock on the market, they’re dominating Europe and like the Beatles they just arrived in the USA! This isnt a stock it’s a God damn Arms Race! And Rheinmetall is the Golden Goose sucking up all the Dollar Bills.\nTheir current pipeline of sales and orders, coupled with its strategic expansions and strong market position, provide a solid foundation for continued growth. Gains!\n\nThe company's ability to outperform market expectations consistently, as evidenced by its 91% increase in operating result and improved margins, suggests that Rheinmetall is well-positioned to capitalize on the current geopolitical climate and defense spending trends. As CEO Armin Papperger stated, the company is experiencing a \"supercycle\" of growth, which is likely to continue driving its stock performance in the foreseeable future. \nSo do the right thing, Buy Rheinmetall and become a War Profiteer behind the best performing stock of 2024!\n","image":[{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"gpifwsojf6z9"}},"id":"6ZzpTaBVi96F6RFOLHa6tT","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2024-09-06T13:11:54.662Z","updatedAt":"2024-09-06T13:11:54.662Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"apple-100x-wtf","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/gpifwsojf6z9/6ZzpTaBVi96F6RFOLHa6tT/1a0d0a7accb69a3996eddbbb7692fe13/apple.jpg","details":{"size":314628,"image":{"width":1080,"height":1080}},"fileName":"apple.jpg","contentType":"image/png"}}}]}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
